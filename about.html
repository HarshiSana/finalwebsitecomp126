        <h3>Drake</h3>

        <p>
          "Defeat Street Therapy has been pretty substantial for me in my
          recovery process. After what Pusha T did to me in 2018, I had constant
          nightmares about him and the whole situation to be honest. For him to
          absolutely EMASCULATE me in front of the whole world and make me raise
          a child that I didn't want, was tramautizing. I came to Defeat Street
          Therapy a short while after, and they immediately started helping me.
          There was a major hurdle I had to overcome in May 2024, where Kendrick
          Lamar continously attacked me and exposed me. That sent me to a dark
          place, but Defeat Street helped me get back on my feet. Outside my
          ghostwriters and the folks that helped me become an industry plant, I
          would say Defeat Street has had the most impact on my life."
        </p>
        <h5>
          Drake recovered, but is now currently serving 10 consecutive life
          sentences in Guatanamo Bay for being a weird with the kids
        </h5>

        <h3>Lil Wayne</h3>

        <p>
          "I am also a victim of Pusha T. He sent me to a very dark place. I
          came to Defeat Street Therapy and they completely turned my life
          around. The various programs and willing to work with me is what
          helped for the better. "
        </p>
        <h5>
          Lil Wayne is doing a lot better now, and learned his lesson to not rip
          off producers by not paying them for their work.
